# Inference efficiency

Measured accuracy and per-request latency of the JevAny releases and other
decision models before and after inference acceleration, on NVIDIA
A100-SXM4-40GB GPUs. How to enable each option is described in
[Optional CUDA acceleration](DEPLOYMENT.md#optional-cuda-acceleration); the
numbers are also in [`results/efficiency-a100-v1.json`](../results/efficiency-a100-v1.json).

## Summary

Whole-model CUDA Graph capture gives the largest-model speedups when the model
fits on one H200:

| Model | Fixed latency panel | Default median | Accelerated median | Speed-up | Accuracy |
|:---|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| JevAny-Qwen3.8-27B | JevBench public, 231 | 113.54 ms | **30.53 ms** | **3.72×** | 207/231 → 207/231 |
| JevAny-Muse-Glimmer-30B | Transfer balanced sample, 44 | 100.71 ms | **43.25 ms** | **2.33×** | 38/44 → 38/44 |

Neither run had an argmax change. The 30B audit separates fused SDPA's 1.15×
median gain from CUDA Graphs' further 2.03× gain, with 96 graph calls and no
eager fallback. Its [machine-readable audit](../results/efficiency-h200-muse30-v1.json)
uses 44 short requests, so compare latency only within each row, not across the
two panels. See the [serving configuration](DEPLOYMENT.md#optional-cuda-acceleration).

The table and plot below are the separate A100-40GB comparison. The 27B and
30B models require layer sharding on 40 GB cards, which prevents whole-model
CUDA Graph capture; their 1.1× rows measure kernels + fused SDPA instead.

| Model | GPUs | Default median | Accelerated median | Speed-up | Transfer accuracy |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| JevAny-Qwen3.5-4B | 1 | 104.6 ms | 25.3 ms | 4.1× | 78.68% → 78.87% |
| JevAny-Qwen3.5-4B-Direct-Token | 1 | 106.4 ms | 25.9 ms | 4.1× | 78.11% → 78.39% |
| JevAny-Gemma-4B | 1 | 106.3 ms | 31.9 ms | 3.3× | 70.84% → 70.84% |
| JevAny-Muse-Glimmer-30B | 3 | 171.2 ms | 154.2 ms | 1.1× | 83.37% → 83.37% |
| JevAny-Qwen3.8-27B | 3 | 240.2 ms | 220.1 ms | 1.1× | 85.66% → 85.66% |
| JevAny-Qwen3.8-27B | 2 | — | 212.5 ms | — | 85.66% |

Medians are on Transfer-v9. The single-GPU 4B models gain most from CUDA
graphs, which remove per-kernel launch overhead at batch size one. The 27B and
30B models do not fit on one 40 GB GPU, so they run layer-sharded with
`--device-map auto` and without CUDA graphs. They gain only from the
linear-attention kernels and fused SDPA. Two GPUs with `--max-memory-gib 31`
are enough for the 27B model and are as fast as three.

## Setup

- **Requests:** batch size 1, serial requests; every request has one question.
- **Suites:**
  - Transfer-v9 development split: 1,264 requests, of which 1,046 are scored.
  - JevBench public: 231 questions.
- **Latency:**
  - JevAny rows time the model call (backbone forward, readout and the
    probability transfer to the CPU) and exclude tokenization.
  - Third-party rows time each project's own inference call, which includes
    its tokenization.
- **Warm-up:** re-runs drop their first five requests. The Default rows of the
  27B, 30B and third-party models come from the original evaluation runs.
- **Accuracy** is re-measured in every configuration, so each table shows how
  far the faster kernels move predictions.

| Configuration | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| Default | JevAny's evaluation path (`LocalPredictor`: math SDPA kernel, TF32 off) without the optional kernels below. Third-party models run their official inference code in the same kind of environment. |
| + kernels | `flash-linear-attention` 0.5.2 and `causal-conv1d` 1.7.0 installed; Transformers uses them for Gated DeltaNet layers. |
| + fused SDPA | PyTorch's fused SDPA kernels, which `jevany serve` uses by default. |
| + CUDA graphs | `--cuda-graphs`, with lengths captured up to 16,384 tokens. The current default captures up to `--cuda-graph-max-tokens 2048`, so longer rows stay eager. |
| + own CUDA graphs | decider's built-in CUDA-graph engine. |

Gemma 4, Jev-Omni (Gemma 4) and Laya (ModernBERT) have no Gated DeltaNet layers,
so the kernels do not apply. Jev-Omni and Laya were therefore not re-run.

\* decider compiles each new input shape on first use, and that compilation is
included in the mean. Its median and p90 describe steady-state latency.

## Notes

- **Checkpoint version:** JevAny-Qwen3.8-27B was measured at step 22,160. The
  current step 44,319 release has the same architecture, so the latencies
  apply. Its accuracy is reported in [EVALUATION.md](EVALUATION.md).
- **JevBench conversion:** JevBench was converted from the public data with
  `scripts/build_external_eval.py`. The resulting `development.jsonl` differs
  from the official `jevbench-public-v1.4.2.2` file, so JevBench accuracies here
  can differ from [EVALUATION.md](EVALUATION.md) by a few hard-tier questions.
- **JevBench p90 with CUDA graphs:** p90 is slightly higher with graphs than
  without, because long requests were padded to the next captured length. The
  current 2,048-token capture limit keeps those requests on eager inference.
- **Comparing across rows:** every row uses the same GPU type, but some
  comparisons span different nodes of the cluster. That adds a few percent of
  run-to-run variation.

`python scripts/plot_efficiency.py`.
